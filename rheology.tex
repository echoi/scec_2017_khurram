    DynEarthSol3D (DES3D)~\citep{Choi2013,Tan2013,Ta2015,Logan2017} is an explicit dynamic finite element code providing quasi-static solutions to the momentum balance equation via the dynamic relaxation~\citep{Cundall1989} and mass scaling~\citep[e.g.][]{Chung1998}. The explicit formulation makes it easy to implement complex rheologies. The limit on time step size is a drawback associated with an explicit time integration but the mass scaling technique can mitigate it to some degree.
    
    In this project, we are going to use the Mohr-Coulomb elasto-plastic rheology. This rheology is suitable for describing elastic and brittle behaviors of rocks as in \texttt{fdfault} without complications from rate-dependent creep as in viscoelastic or elasto-visco-plastic rheologies. That we can choose to exclude completely time-dependent creep behaviors from consideration not only ensures seamless coupling with \texttt{fdfault} but also must subdue the unwarrented but often-raised doubt about the legitimacy of using \texttt{DES3D} for interseismic time scales of 1-1000 years.
    
    Recent extension of the Mohr-Coulomb rheology in \texttt{DES3D} to the rate-and-state friction [Tong and Lavier, \emph{in prep}] further demonstrates that this code can handle the rheology perfectly relevant to earthquake cycles. In Tong and Lavier's approach, velocity magnitude is evaluated, the state variable is updated based on it and the rate-and-state friction coefficient ($\mu_{RS}$) is computed based on the updated velocity and state variable at each quadrature point of an element. $\mu_{RS}$ is then used in the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion as well as in the return mapping for stress update. %The explicit formulation of \texttt{DES3D} enables us to implement the rate-and-state friction law without invoking iterative non-linear solution schemes, which are necessary in the usual quasi-static formulation.
    
    In an example showin in Fig.~\ref{fig:RSfriction}, a 10 km-thick layer of elastic crust is sheared to initiate and maintain earthquake cycles. A 2 km-thick pre-existing shear zone is in contact with the crustal layer and composed of the Mohr-Coulomb plastic materials with rate-and-state friction. Due to the shear loading, shear stress elastically accumulates in both layers. When plastic yielding occurs in the shear zone, the coseismic slip and release of elastic stress occurs and the rate-and-state friction governs this stress-releasing process. $\mu_{RS}$ is given as
    \begin{equation}
      \mu_{RS} = \mu_{0} + a\,\ln (V/V_{0}) + b \, \ln (V_{0}\,\theta/L),
    \end{equation}
    where $mu_{0}$ is the reference friction coefficient, $\theta$ is the state variable that evolves in time as $\dot{\theta}=1-V\theta/L$, $V$ is the slip velocity, $V_{0}$ and $L$ are reference velocity and characteristic length scale. In the shown example, we set $\mu_{0}$ = 0.6, $V_{0}$ = 10$^{-6}$ m/s and $L$ = 3 mm. Also, $a$ = 0.015, $b$ = 0.019 for velocity-weakening patch (central 50 km-wide region in the shear zone) while $a$ = 0.0019  and $b$ = 0.0015 for velocity-strengthening patches. As evident in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:RSfriction}, the implemented rate-and-state friction law successfully reproduces the quasi-periodic earthquake cycles.
